# The Survivability of Passengers in Titanic Demise - A Machine Learning Approach in Python

Introduction

The Titanic, the largest British luxury passenger liner that is famous worldwide perished in the North Atlantic Ocean after striking with an iceberg on her inaugural journey from Southampton to New York City in the early hours of April 15, 1912. The tragic tragedy resulted in 1,500 deaths out of the 2,224 passengers and personnel on board the ship. Despite the passage of time, curiosity in the Titanic is now as high as it was then.

Many people search tirelessly for facts about this disaster and hopefully it is very interesting on exactly what happened in that terrible, freezing cold April night? According to the historical facts, attempts were made to reach the neighboring vessels, and the life boats were instructed to rescue the passengers, giving priority to women and children. The Titanic sank with over a thousand passengers and staff members aboard. The unfortunate disaster startled the whole world and caused significant frustration due to lack of life boats, inadequate laws, and the unequal treatment of third class passengers during the evacuation. The study will intend to perform a statistical analysis on the Titanic Dataset available in Kaggle to determine unsinkable facts about the tragedy of Titanic.
